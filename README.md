# dlcache 4 nodejs

A simple download cache for single files/urls.

Uses the file system as a database. Not too efficient for huge amounts of tiny files, but quite optimal for your typical source code tar ball.

Please refer to the [documentation in the source code](index.js#L53) and to the [parent meta repository](https://github.com/jjYBdx4IL/dlcache).
